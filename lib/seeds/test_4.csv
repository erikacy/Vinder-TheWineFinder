"126941","Turkey","A nose of raspberry, brambles and confectioner's sugar gives way to flavors of strawberry, peach, menthol and eucalyptus. A fairly stiff tannic structure and tart, slightly green notes keep this wine from fully coming together on the palate.","Casaba",87,16,"Turkey","","Yazgan 2014 Casaba Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Turkey)","Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot","Yazgan","Deep Ruby","https://vinderapp.s3.amazonaws.com/deep+ruby.png"

"127251","Spain","Rubber, iodine and a heavy dosage of oak char create a smoky but one-dimensional bouquet. This is round and full in the mouth, with jammy black-plum and berry flavors that ultimately get overshadowed by char and bitter chocolate notes. Lasting barrel influence makes for a toasty, blackened finish.","Tradición",87,30,"Galicia","Ribeira Sacra","Adegas Moure 2011 Tradición Mencía (Ribeira Sacra)","Mencía","Adegas Moure","Pale Purple","https://vinderapp.s3.amazonaws.com/pale+purple.png"
"127374","US","This is a big Pinot Noir, dark and full bodied and juicy in pomegranates, cherries, red plums and sautéed wild mushrooms, and the interplay of oak with fruit even yields richer notes of milk chocolate. It's devastatingly good, but also too young and fresh now to show its best. With its fine tannins and exquisite balance, this articulate young wine should be best after 2013.","The Narrows Vineyard",96,75,"California","Anderson Valley","Goldeneye 2007 The Narrows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)","Pinot Noir","Goldeneye","Pale Ruby","https://vinderapp.s3.amazonaws.com/pale+ruby.png"
"127423","US","This is the most accessible of Stemmler's trio of new 2010 Pinots. It offers rich raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors, and shows a fine balance of all its parts.

"127521","US","This combines 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Syrah and 11% Cabernet Franc, the trio integrating perfectly, with density and tannic grip.

"127776","France","Despite the intense green aromas and flavors this wine possesses, it has its strong points. Namely, nice balance, a good mouthfeel and a certain cleanliness that shouldn't be overlooked. But be warned: If green flavors like bell pepper and jalapeño are not for you, you might want to steer clear of this offering. Green is the dominant characteristic, from front to back.","",86,20,"Loire Valley","Sancerre","Domaine de la Chezatte 2000  Sancerre","Sauvignon Blanc","Domaine de la Chezatte","Pale Copper","https://vinderapp.s3.amazonaws.com/pale+copper.png"

"128375","Germany","Sunny tangerine acidity showers over plump honeydew and yellow plums in this lip-smacking, opulent spätlese. Refreshing grapefruit and green floral notes kiss the long, lingering finish.

"128468","South Africa","Also known as a Cape Blend, this mix of 46% Pinotage, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc is an easy-drinking, youthful wine with fresh but rich fruit flavors of red plum and cherry backed by rose hip and hibiscus floral accents.

"128514","Chile","Floral aromas of violet, lemon peel, Graham cracker, plum and boysenberry stray from normal. This Cabernet-led blend feels wide, jammy and little soft in the center.

"129296","France","Lovely notes of ripe mirabelle plum and yellow apple play on the nose.

"129595","US","Rich yet plenty retentive of acidity, this coastal white is complex in tropical mango and papaya while also offering finely tuned layers of fig and honeycomb.

"129622","Ukraine","Fresh apple notes on the nose of this off-dry sparkling are pretty, but hindered by whiffs of dust and green stems.
